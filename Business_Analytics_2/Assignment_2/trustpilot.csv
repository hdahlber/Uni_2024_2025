I Emailed customer services to which I did not receive a reply for a couple of weeks. When I eventually got through to live chat I was refunded without being given the option to have a replacement sent. When asked about this I received the response 'we do not offer automatic exchanges' when I reminded the agent they lost my parcel the response was 'my mistake, I suggest you reorder'. I will be reordering but not from Zalando.",Britain (UK),Zalando

599db6caa64b4105d836d4fc,Horrific customer service skills.,"Horrific customer service skills! In 2017, you would expect to be able to pay online via card payment but oh no! And when you contact customer services, you get greeted by somebody telling you they cannot assist you about adding card payment rather than PayPal, even though the website clearly states you can. If you ask to speak to a superior, you will rudely be told no, and informed that they know as little on the subject as you. If you ask to speak to anyone in regards to the matter, they will tell you that nobody in the whole company, an online one may I add, knows how to advice you on making a card payment to a website based clothing store. An absolute farce. I will be taking my custom back to ASOS and advice you all to do the same.",Britain (UK),Zalando

57cf0ac00000ff000984dec0,Not Straight Forward With Their Shipping,"I ordered a skirt last Sunday under 6 - 8 shipping days. The skirt also said that it is available to be shipped within 24hrs. On Monday morning I received an email saying that the item was shipped. I thought, oh great! however for a whole week now fedex tracking number has labeled created. I bought this item for an event on the 12th was hoping to get it by the 11th. I am extremely worried that I will not get it in time. I have no use for it after the 12th. This is very frustrating. When a company writes that it ships in 24 hrs and shipping takes 6-8 shipping days; that should mean that at the very most the item will arrive in 9 days!!!!!! This is very disappointing because this was my first time ordering through this website and if the item does not come on time, then I will prob. never use it again. #disappointing",United States,Sheinside

It arrived roughly three weeks from when I purchased it. I was very pleased with the shipping, especially since they noted how long I was expected to wait.

5624f9d10000ff0009124709,terrible,"Was given a three hour window of delivery, waited in. Delivery driver knocked on door but waited less than 30 seconds before leaving so I did not get to the door in time. Was informed that delivery could subsequently not be made until the following Monday, but I explained we were going away and asked for them to arrange for it to be redelivered the same day (as I first contacted them within half an hour of the attempted delivery the driver should have still been relatively nearby). They said they had contacted the delivery company (hermes) who refused to redeliver before Monday. They (Zalando) told me they had made a decision without asking me,  to instruct Hermes to return to sender and claimed they had refunded the item. I wrote to explain to them I had in the interim time postponed - at great inconvenience and some expense - our trip to be able to be in on the Monday. I had no reply. Tried again, no reply. I decided as the original order was going to be returned to sender to simply reorder the item as we now would not be going away until Thursday - after I had done this I was informed directly by Hermes that the original order was now out for delivery totally contradicting what Zalando had told me - as we were no longer expecting any delivery on the Monday I had not stayed in and subsequently missed the delivery. I wrote to Zalando to ask what was going on and for them to rectify the situation - I asked them to make sure that the reordered item get to me by Thursday having already been put through an awful lot of incnvenience, messing about and stress as well as expense. The lack of care, responsibility or organisation is staggering. I presently am now in the situation of having two of the item in question on order and having postponed a trip and do not have any way of knowing if or when either of the orders will come as Zalando have stopped replying to my emails. I have never been messed about by any company in such a way. It is ridiculous.",Britain (UK),Zalando

They do not return all your money because they claim there is a restocking fee.  If my order had truly arrived at the store then the order tracking on the WISH website should have been updated to say it arrived!  If it did arrive, then why was I not called to say that my order was ready to be picked up? Of course there is no customer service, it is just an automated system.  The website states that if you have additional problems to contact your credit card company!  Last year I ordered some Bose headphones, it was obvious when they arrived that they were counterfeit.

Sheinside is full of gorgeous clothes with amazing discounts. This website is one of my favorite websites that I have visited to purchase women's clothing. They offer TONS of sales and discounts. I will definitely purchase from here again. The gold diamond chain necklace was on sale 2 dollars off for $8.60. This is a very reasonable price in my opinion. I was also impressed with all of the other necklaces that the website offered. It was very difficult to choose between the wide variety of items. Ordering, shipping, and delivering was no problem. They cover standard shipping costs which is wonderful. There were no issues at all with the item. It is a beautiful Necklace! Overall, I had a very great experience with Sheinside. I received a discount, no shipping issues, and a beautiful necklace. I highly recommend this website and specifically this necklace to everyone. Thank you!",United States,Sheinside

It is all good with them since you actually face a problem. It happened to me today. I phoned customer services regarding a return for a faulty item and the person I was speaking to refused to help me. It is sounds unreal,  does not it? Well, it is true. Imagine I was shocked and frustrated for actually being mocked instead of being helped, so I asked for his name which he refused to provide stating ""I do not have to provide you with my name"" and after I asked to speak to somebody else, he started laughing. As frustrated and shocked as I was, blaming myself now for actually using their service for the past 6 years, I thought I should ask for a reference number on the conversation,  thinking maybe I could resolve the issue with somebody else from customer services, and thinking maybe it is not the company I should blame, maybe it is just the person I am actually talking to. But then the reply came: ""I am entitled to refuse providing you with a reference number"" . So here I am shocked,  frustrated, stuck with a faulty £90 pair of trainers, and extremely unsatisfied as a customer. One thing is for sure: I will NEVER USE ZALANDO services AGAIN!

Then received another email saying they are sorry for the situation and that I could have a 20% off code for the inconvenience, I was extremely happy at this as it was beyond the call of duty to do this. I then received another email a few hours later saying how sorry they were the whole situation and that they were not only giving me a 20% off code, they actually refunded me the money back for both polo shirts and I did not need to return the items back!

I really like how you can see customer ratings and reviews for each individual item, as it is useful to help make better purchasing decisions. There are also notice pop-ups on items if the fit is smaller or larger than normal. My only complaint would be the size guides - considering they are a marketplace that retails A LOT of different brands, rather than having one generalised size guide, they should ensure that each (clothing and footwear) brand that signs up submits their own size guide. That way the sizing information would be more accurate. Other than that, delivery's always by Hermes and whilst I have a really good local Hermes courier, if you do not, this could be a potential issue worth noting. Returns are easy and straightforward, however I have never had to deal with Customer Service so I am biased. Would be nice if Zalando implemented a points/reward system for those of us who shop on their site regularly. Also, there is only standard delivery option which sucks, because it would be better to offer a Next Day delivery option, however I have never had to pay for delivery on Zalando - it is always free.

When I contacted them by phone to explain the necklace was definitely inside the box and requested them to investigate and look inside the box again they stated the warehouse has said the box was empty and the warehouse has sent a photo as well and they will not listen to me and will believe the warehouse only. The horrible rude person put the phone down on me and refused to listen to a word I was saying. Someone from their warehouse has stolen the necklace and the company knows it.

609c0c5af9f4870a94a0518f,"Misleading, counterfeit, wrong website, awful products, terrible customer service","This website is VERY bad. They have sellers who sell misleading, totally defective products, that will not work for you. Then they will never refund or even apologize. As an example, i bought two Mummy and me dresses from them. The seller claimed dresses are cotton. They are not. They are pure synthetic (after I received them in almost 2 months after placing the order). On top of that, Mother's dress is defective, having a hole, and badly made. And one of the sleeves leaves a deep scar-looking trace on my arm, as the ribbon is too tight even for a baby arm. I had the trace for 2 days after taking the dress off!! It is an injury!! Around the same time, I ordered the shoes from that website (not knowing HOW bad they are yet). The shoes came in a separate package after the defective dresses. Needless to say, instead of a claimed 'leather' the shoes were synthetic. On top of that, it is impossible to connect them in any way to a foot. Seriously. I was not able to make a single step in them. They are created not for humans. I do not know how they could come up with such construction and configuration, but the shoes are not functioning. Nobody even apologized, not talking about giving a refund to me. Misleading, counterfeit, wrong website, awful products, terrible customer service.",United States,Wish

539efa3000006400029138b4,you pay for what you get? NOT,"It usually is true when people say you get what you paid for but this is often not true IF you are a smart shopper (like me) especially when dealing with China based retailers/suppliers, it goes the same everywhere. First tip, check the reviews before purchasing. Note that there can be many ""fake"" reviews by people who just wants to collect sheinside points for discounts it is usually very identifiable because no one would only put ""excellent!"" or ""pretty"" etc if they are actually really happy about the purchase and decided to even put some effort to leave a review. look out for negative comments and see if it applies to you because may shoppers do not look at the measurements of the clothing (which is also the 2nd tip, ALWAYS CHECK THE MEASUREMENT DETAILS!!!) before buying (you should know your own body's measurement if not just get a measuring tape. it only costs like 1 dollar on ebay). As asian sizes often run small, a US size S body will never fit into an Asian size S clothing. so please check the measurements, i get annoyed when people leave a negative comment for not reading the details and measurements prior to their purchase. What to do if there is no reviews, do not buy it just yet. if you are really into that specific clothing, check around Aliexpress for their reviews because there is many sellers selling the same chinese stuff from the same suppliers. If that still does not work, I would advise you to save your money and just be patient to wait for reviews. Also, people might ask why buy from Sheinside if Aliexpress is almost always cheaper (up to half the price)? I think it really depends on how broke you are at the time and how urgent you need the clothing. Sellers from aliexpress offers cheap prices with the cheapest mode of shipping which can take more than 1 month to arrive at your doorstep, aliexpress does not accept Paypal anymore. Sheinside ships your items with priority parcels (as far as I know, it ships to australia with TOLL which took less than a week every time). I am not sure about other countries though. I have purchased from Sheinside for the 3rd time now with more than 10 pieces of clothing, only to have one which was sent in the wrong size but got partially refunded.

Tracking has not been updated in over two weeks. I Am assuming I will never receive. I am also a wardrobe stylist so now I have to go buy ALL new clothes for my upcoming projects.

60c0102bf9f4870a0ca6e7e1,Horrible Return Policy,"BEWARE! Returns are difficult! The product (building bricks set) was received defective. I was on bag 5 (out of 36 bags) when I noticed an important piece was missing (no I did not lose it as I was very careful). Also, this store is a drop shipper that increased the price over $100 from the supplier! I received the package with a supplier card and went to the supplier website to find out. Then there is the issue of the supplier ships some products (such as this castle) for free so the $12 shipping fee is ridiculously high since the supplier is the one mailing the product. Plus, this seller is basically giving away my information to the supplier as they need to type my info to the supplier site to order the item! This seems fishy. Beware! There is also the issue of returns being difficult on Wish as they give us the run around and waste time by taking 2-3 days for each response and not do what I asked. The return policy is 30 days and they ignored my wishes for return. Long time buyer and first time returning anything. I am completely disappointed.

A comforter for $18.00 magically became $32.00 in the cart. And the shipping costs are astronomical.

5406c5cc0000640002a30f64,"Cute clothes, fab quality!","The first time I ever heard about Sheinside was when a beauty/fashion guru blogger from my country posted a Sheinside haul with a bunch of stuff she bought there. There were plenty of pics with her wearing the clothes and links to specific pieces she was showing on the website. I  could tell right away that these clothes indeed looked just as good on her as they did on the website's promo pictures which is a fabulous sign of quality. That really impressed me, because I had a bad experience with a popular online clothes store (that shall remain unnamed) when I made an order and the dress I received looked NOTHING and I repeat nothing like the pictures. But anyway, her review was so stellar and excited that I decided to make a purchase myself. I like fashion that is a bit edgy and funky and the Sheinside website had loads of selection so I was able to find a bunch of stuff that I really really liked. I really liked the website outlay as it was intuitive and easy to follow. The order process was so easy as well. Buuuut... Since I had the previous bad experience with the shall-remain-unnamed site, I went to check the reviews for the store first, and trustpilot was one of the first ones I checked. And let me tell you, it got me a bit worried. There were several bad reviews and unhappy customers, people complaining that it took forever or that they did not get their stuff at all or that the stuff was not as good as expected. So, for my first purchase I just bought a single (very sweet by the way) shirt, to make sure everything goes well. I certainly did not want to spend a lot of money and end up pissed and disappointed - again. And let me tell you, I have no idea what these people are talking about! My experience was brill! My package got to me rally really fast and was wrapped up nicely. The clothes were as good as the pictures were, really nice fabrics. I have since made several more purchases and never had a single problem. That is why I decided to make this review so that people can make a more informed decision. One word of caution though. Please be careful when choosing sizes and go by the measurements. When in doubt, go a size larger. And have fun! I love love love this store, and I am so glad I made a leap of faith and gave it a go.",Croatia,Sheinside

60bd0bf0f9f4870a94b7afdd,Avoid at all costs!!!!,Do not buy! I am appalled by my first and last purchase on Wish. I bought some foliage tiles to decorate a fence panel in my back garden. The listing was advertised as 10 foliage tiles in the title and on the photos and only 1 came! I checked the listing (and prices) at time of purchase multiple times and I am very conscious of being scammed etc so I did not just leap head first into the purchase without reading correctly. Wish were quick to say I received the correct quantity and refused to help. A huge relief that I paid via PayPal as although it took a couple of months mediating between us they managed to get me a refund if I returned the item and reimbursed me for my costs. The parcel actually got returned to me which makes me wonder whether it was refused however once I reported this to PayPal they closed the case in my favour. Actually needed more than 10 of these tiles so glad I did not purchase more as they are clearly going out of their way to mislead! Avoid!!!,Britain (UK),Wish

On all occasions the delivery was delayed and I received the same untruthful messages that the currier missed me and then that there was a problem with access to my property. These were blatant lies. In fact my work colleague had the exact same experience with exact same lines given to her. After finally receiving the orders, I returned one. My return was showing as ""not received"" in the system 2 weeks after posting it back through their currier. When I called the customer service and demanded answers, miraculously, I was told that the return goods had arrived several days earlier but that the system was showing wrong information. When I asked why the refund had not been issued, I got no answer but the rep issued the refund whilst I was on the telephone.  My next order had 8 items which I needed for my skiing holiday. 5 out of 8 showed as CANCELLED several days after order was taken. They sold the stock which they did not have and only let me know after the fact. I got notification a week later that some items were again available. 10 days later delivery still has not arrived. Customer service told me it would be made yesterday. We stayed all day at home and again, the tracking update says ""Sorry we have missed you"". Again, this is a lie. Nobody tried to deliver, no note was left anywhere. I am going away and needed these goods for holiday. Customer Service would not cancel the order now and refund money. As previously, they told me to wait for delivery, despite the unreasonable delays, then have me return it and then wait several weeks again for a refund.

In case you are wondering ""Oh, I bet she did not look at their measurments"" well I DID check their measurements and I ordered the largest size they had, which should have had enough room if it was MADE PROPERLY, but alas, the cheapped out on the material. I wish I could post a photo of how awful this coat is. The seams are crooked, the buttons are not sewn straight, and there is at least 6"" less fabric than necessary through the waist. Even when laid flat, you can see they cut fabric away from the bottom of the coat where you usually need more fabric. UGH! Never EVER again!!",United States,Sheinside

(The dress was originally $25.) Then they offered me $15, etc. Everytime I replied that I wanted a full refund and they could have the dress back. Since it was their error, I expected them to pay for shipping. Finally, I had to get tough, and they agreed to refund me. BUT THEN... I checked my credit card statement and they shorted me almost $6, however on their website it claims they refunded me in full. So once again, I emailed them and threatened to take further action. I was not concerned about the misely $6, it was the idea that they thought they could be sneaky and do that! Finally, after almost 3 months of dealing with them. I have been fully refunded.

541cd35b0000640002a6e215,Great honest company with alot of variety,I found out about Sheinside through a friend and thought I would check it out. I ended up buying quite a few  items. I bought a couple dresses and accessories.  I put the order in and then received the items in about 2 weeks. Everything came together and was packaged nicely. All the items fit well and the material was very comfortable. I loved the accessories.  This site is a one stop shop. This is a great company with a lot of variety.  The site is easy to go through and they always have awesome sales.  I highly recommend this site.,United States,Sheinside

Over a month ago now I ordered items for my brother in uni for his birthday and because none of us are at the delivery address I left a note telling the courier where to leave it. I phone someone to pick it up for me and drop it to my brother and they tell me the box is there but it is empty so there is an array of things that could have happened such as being stolen or just simply not put in the box or somehow lost I do not know. The box was extremely damaged with large cracks on both sides. 7 days they told me they will get back to me. It is been a month, Guess what, NOTHING! I have emailed them and phoned them countless times but I just feel like giving up because it seems like a circus over there if it takes this long. By the looks of it it looks like they will not accept blame anyway and just say that is £200 vanished into thin air.

So far so good.  Then it went quiet.  No updates and when I tried tracking my order it showed the courier was delayed.  2 weeks later I emailed Zalando asking for an update only to receive a refund and a stock message saying the boots had been lost in the post and blaming Hermes.

54c25e7b0000ff0002c7036b,So many stylish options!,"I recently stumbled upon the SheInside website.  Wow!  These guys have so many great clothing options to choose from!  I needed a dress for an upcoming event, something classy.  I found so many options, but settled on the yellow and black lace Bodycon dress.   This website makes it so easy to order clothing online.  They had a very clear sizing chart in the dress details, which is not always the case.  There was no second guessing myself about what size to order; I often struggle with this when ordering clothing online.  (By having these measurements displayed, it cuts down on my chances of having to return an item for not fitting.)  My dress arrived exactly when they estimated it would and it fit PERFECT!!  I am extremely happy with my purchase.  I cannot recommend this site enough.  They have such great, stylish clothes for an affordable price.

53908bf500006400028ed488,"Amazing company, amazing products 10/10","I had my reservations about buying from here as I read a LOT of terrible reviews saying how the products were terrible quality, the shipping caused loads of trouble and how the whole site is a scam. Well from my personal experience this is completely untrue. I bought a white cotton summer dress and a PU leather bag which are amazing quality. I did not read the description of the dress in depth enough so it was a welcome surprise to find that the dress was even lined. It was a one size dress which made me nervous, but as the back was elasticated it fit absolutely perfectly. It is amazingly well made, wonderful quality and looks lovely on. I am more than happy with the dress and the bag is also amazing, well stitched and sturdy. Another thing I was nervous about was the shopping as some reviews said it took up to a month to reach them, but as it comes from china, I expected this and was happy to wait this long, however I recieved it within a week which I was not expecting. Payment went through smoothly (via PayPal) and I had no problems with that. The order tracking kept me updated every time the package made any sort of movement so I knew where it was at all times. The bargain prices on this website are literally that, a bargain, I managed to get these amazing quality clothes for only £22, and being a student I like to get my clothes as cheap as possible. Overall I would absolutely recommend this website to everyone and I think it is amazing. I would just recommend checking the sizing of the clothes as it is coming from china, so the sizes are slightly smaller (I am normally a small but I fit a medium from this site) but if you read the detailed size guide you will be able to work out what you need. I urge people not to worry about bad reviews, my experience with this website was fantastic and I will absolutely be buying from here again.",Britain (UK),Sheinside
